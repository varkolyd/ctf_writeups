Hack a scammer's website and ruin their day.

First scan the ports with rustscan:\

Ports:\
Open 10.10.197.14:22 - SSH\
Open 10.10.197.14:80 - HTTP\
Open 10.10.197.14:139 - NetBIOS\
Open 10.10.197.14:445 - SMB

Now let's inspect this IP in our browser.

It is a basic apache webserver welcome site, but there's probably more hidden underneath. Find it out with gobuster!

![gobuster](https://github.com/varkolyd/ctf_writeups/blob/main/THM%20-%20Tech_Supp0rt%201/tech_supp0rt%201%20images/gobuster.png)

*/test* and */wordpress* are the directories we are looking for here so let's check both of them.

![test](https://github.com/varkolyd/ctf_writeups/blob/main/THM%20-%20Tech_Supp0rt%201/tech_supp0rt%201%20images/test.png)

Test is basically a static scammer site, can't really click anywhere. I've looked into the source code but besides the images not much seems to be here.
Let's try wordpress maybe we will find more useful stuff there.

![wp](https://github.com/varkolyd/ctf_writeups/blob/main/THM%20-%20Tech_Supp0rt%201/tech_supp0rt%201%20images/wordpress.png)

Okay so here we could browse all the tabs and hope for the best and be lazy and run gobuster. I did both.

`gobuster dir -u http://10.10.197.14/wordpress -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -x php,html,txt,sh`
    /license.txt          (Status: 200) [Size: 19915]
    /readme.html          (Status: 200) [Size: 7345]
    /wp-admin             (Status: 301) [Size: 325] [--> http://10.10.197.14/wordpress/wp-admin/]
    /wp-includes          (Status: 301)[Size:328][-->http://10.10.197.14/wordpress/wp-includes/]

I did the same with /test but havenâ€™t found anything useful
